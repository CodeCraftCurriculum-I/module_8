# Assignment
Before you write any code, you should "sketch" the pseudo code and make a flowchart for how you plan to do the following alterations to the game.

- Improve the code (readability, maintainability)
- Make the normal / hard choice in the menu have an effect on the game.
- Make it so that the player has 3 lives. (crashing should decrease the life and restart the level).
- Create 2 new levels
- Add side wind, display in HUD direction of wind. Wind should impact the lander
- Give points for remaining fuel.
- Give points for speed. 
- Add a view between the game and menu where there is a summary of result (play time, score)
- Make the HigScore in the main menu real. i.e. results should be from actual played games, results should be kept between games.
